# Ford-Mazda-Assistant-App

This project is an application created using the Streamlit frontend library. Its purpose is to simplify the spreadsheets below so that users can select their desired vehicle based on make/model/year. The application then displays some characteristics of an anti-theft system for the selected year/model, along with the complete key learning procedure when one of the security system components is replaced.

**Application Features:**
  1. **Input:**
     * There is a sidebar and three select boxes where the user can choose the car manufacturer, vehicle model, and 
         year.
  2. **Output:**
     
     * **Mazda:** when selecting the Mazda manufacturer, model, and year, it shows the selected vehicle. The necessary key learning procedure is provided, along with a button to 
     download a file containing the required steps for key programming.

     * **Ford:** for Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury manufacturers, the selected vehicle is displayed, and users are guided through the necessary key learning process. Depending on the 
     year/model selected, it shows the key quantity required, starter motor and anti-theft system light status.
