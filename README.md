# Ford-Mazda-Assistant-App

This project is an application created using the Streamlit frontend library. Its purpose is to simplify the spreadsheets below so that users can select their desired vehicle based on make/model/year. The application then displays some characteristics of an anti-theft system for the selected year/model, along with the complete key learning procedure when one of the security system components is replaced.

This is the link to directly access the application: https://ford-mazda-pats-assistant.streamlit.app/
